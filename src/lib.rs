//! A very small and fast executor for one Future on one
//! thread. Lightweight enough to have many of them.
//!
//! Primarily useful for test suites where you want to step through
//! execution and make assertions about state, but also useful for
//! benchmarks or anywhere else where you don't need more.
//!
//! The easiest way to use this is with the [`woke!()`] macro, which
//! packages up a future together with an executor for convenient
//! polling and pins it on the stack:
//!
//! ```
//! use core::task::Poll;
//! use wookie::woke;
//! let future = async { true };
//! woke!(future);
//! assert_eq!(unsafe { future.as_mut().poll() }, Poll::Ready(true));
//! // or in one step...
//! woke!(future: async { true });
//! assert_eq!(unsafe { future.as_mut().poll() }, Poll::Ready(true));
//! ```
//!
//! In some circumstances, you might need a [`Waker`] without actually
//! having a Future to execute. For this you can use the [`wookie!()`]
//! macro which creates just the executor and pins it to the stack:
//!
//! ```
//! use core::task::Poll;
//! use futures_micro::pin;
//! use wookie::wookie;
//! wookie!(my_executor);
//! let future = async { true };
//! pin!(future);
//! assert_eq!(unsafe { my_executor.as_mut().poll(&mut future) }, Poll::Ready(true));
//! ```
//!
//! Warning: I mean it when I say this is for one thread. I can't tell
//! you exactly what will happen if you wake it on another thread, but
//! it probably won't be good!
